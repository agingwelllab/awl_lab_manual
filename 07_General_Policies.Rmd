# General Policies

## Hours

One of the benefits of a career in academic research is that it is typically more flexible than other kinds of jobs. However, you should still treat it like a job. If you are employed for 40 hours a week, you should be working 40 hours a week. This applies to lab staff members (the lab manager and other research assistants) and postdocs. You are not required to work over-time. For graduate students, I recognize that you have other demands on your time like classes and TA-ing but still expect to see you in lab, doing research, often.

Lab staff members are expected to keep regular office hours (e.g., somewhere in the ballpark of 9-5). Graduate students and postdocs have more flexibility. 

### PI Office Hours

In addition to poking my head into the lab regularly, I will be in my office with the door open for at least an hour every day that I'm at CVL (usually Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays). Feel free to interrupt me during that time. If my door is closed, I am likely in a meeting, on the phone, or doing "deep" work. In that case, please send me a message or try me later rather than knock.

## Deadlines

If you need something from me by a particular deadline, please inform me as soon as you are aware of the deadline so that I can allocate my time as efficiently as possible. __I will expect _at least_ one week's notice__, but I greatly prefer two weeks' notice. Please note that this applies to reading/ commenting on abstracts, papers, and manuscripts, in addition to filling out paperwork, etc. __I will require _at least_ two weeks' notice for letters of recommendation.__ If you do not adhere to these guidelines, I may not be able to meet your deadline.

## Data Products (Posters, Presentations, & Papers)

I encourage you to seek out opportunities to present your research to the department, research community, or general public. Any data products for projects from our lab should be discussed with me __before__ an abstract or draft is created or circulated. As lab director, I am responsible for the research coming out of the lab and I need to approve any data products before they leave the laboratory. Remember, all data products from our lab will ultimately be shared on OSF.

### Manuscripts

If you are drafting a manuscript, congratulations! Scientific writing is different from other types of writing, and so you should be prepared to go through multiple rounds of revision. All drafts should be reviewed _and approved_ by your lab mentor before circulating with all co-authors. Once all co-authors have had a chance to read and comment on a draft, we will post a preprint on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) or [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/) and a link to the preprint will be placed on the project's OSF page. _Only after the preprint has been posted will we submit the manuscript for review._

As a lab, we will use the [Peele lab's checklist]( https://github.com/jpeelle/paperchecklist/blob/master/checklist.pdf) to prepare data sets for publication. 

More to come soon!

### Conference Presentations

If you are going to give a presentation (including posters and talks), please be prepared to give a practice presentation to the lab at least one week ahead of time. Not only will this help you feel comfortable with the presentation, it will give you time to implement any feedback. I care about practice presentations because a) presenting your work is a huge part of being successful in science and it's important that you practice those skills as often as possible, and b) you are going to be representing not only yourself but also the rest of the lab.  

More to come soon!

## Recommendation Letters

Letters of recommendation are one of the many benefits of working in a research lab. I will write a letter for any student or lab member who has spent at least one year in the lab. Letters will be provided for shorter-term lab members in exceptional circumstances (e.g., new graduate students or postdocs applying for fellowships). I maintain this policy because I do not think that I can adequately evaluate someone who has been around for less than a year.

To request a letter of recommendation, please adhere to the deadline requirements described above. Send me (1) your current CV, (2) directions for how to submit the rec letter and (3) any relevant instructions for the contents of the letter. In some but not all cases, I may ask you or your lab mentor to draft a letter, which I will then revise to be consistent with my evaluation. This will ensure that I do not miss any details about your work that you think are relevant to the position you're applying for, and it will also help me complete the letter in a timely fashion.

## Data management

This section is still in development.

### Storing active data sets

### Archiving data

### Data and code organization

To facillitate collaborative work and data sharing, all projects will have a similar file structure. This will also make it easier resume work on a project after a break and facilitate recycling of code for other projects.

```
project 
  |--- 0_get_data.R
  |--- 1_preprocess_data.R
  |--- 2_analyze_data.R
  |--- 3_visualize_data.R
  |--- README.txt
  |--- data
  |--- docs
  |--- figs
  |--- output
  |--- src
```

This  structure is directly stolen from my new favorite blog post, [r best practices](https://kdestasio.github.io/post/r_best_practices/). We will adapt this format as needed for other programming languages.

Code files are stored in the top level of the `project` directory and are named with leading numbers (e.g. `0_get_data.R`) that indicate the order that the scripts should be run in. Also stored in this top-level is a `README.txt` file that contains a description of the project and a brief summary for each folder/file in the project.

`project` is the top-level folder and contains all the files for a project. This folder should be renamed for each unique project in a way that indicates what the project is about.

`data` contains the _raw_ data files used in the project. These files __should not be altered__ and are ideally read-only. Each data file should have a corresponding data dictionary that also lives in this folder.

`doc` contains any manuscripts or interm summaries producted with the project.

`figs` contains any plots, images, tables or figures _created and saved by your code_. It should be possible to delete and regenerate this folder with the scripts in the project folder.

`output` contains non-figure objects created by scripts. For instance, processed data or logs.

`scr` contains scripts for small functions you want to `source()` in your scripts. 

### Data and code sharing

<center>

We will use the Open Science Framework (OSF) for organizing and sharing materials related to our projects. This will include preregistrations, code (sourced from GitHub), posters, and preprints. We will share all data and code using repositories on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) and will share MRI data on [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/). I have created an [AWL project template](https://osf.io/ce8p4/) that you can use when you create a new page for your own project. When you create a new project, just click "More" and search for our template under "Template  (optional)".

### GitHub

We will use git and GitHub for version control. All projects in the lab will have a repository (aka "repo") on GitHub.

To get started with Git/GitHub, I encourage you to read the [Coding Club's Intro to GitHub](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html). We will dedicate at least one lab meeting to a git/GitHub tutorial each year.

Using GitHub not only allows us to keep track of and work collaboratively on projects, but it also makes it easy to share projects on OSF when they are complete. Because we will ultimately share our GitHub repos with the world, I am going to ask lab members to submit pull requests instead of pushing their changes directly to GitHub. In other words, don't be this cat:

## Funding

I will oversee all aspects of the financial management of our funding sources. However, it is important to me to be transparent about where research money comes from and how it's spent. Current funding for the lab comes from my startup package from UT Dallas. 

Hopefully we will have NIH funding in the future. When that happens, we will need to comply with federal guidelines. Also, all research funded by the NIH must acknowledge the grant number upon publication. This is essential for documenting that we are turning their money into research findings. We must also submit a yearly progress report describing what we have accomplished. Lab members involved in the research will be asked to contribute to the progress report.

## Undergraduate research
