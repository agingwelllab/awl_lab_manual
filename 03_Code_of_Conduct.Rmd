# Code of Conduct

All lab members are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation with all members to help ensure a safe environment for everyone. Please also see the [UT Dallas Nondiscrimination policy](https://policy.utdallas.edu/utdbp3090).

### The Quick Version

The Aging Well Lab is committed to providing a harrassment-free environment, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).  We do not tolerate harrassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions.

### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Kendra Seaman immediately. If Kendra is the cause of your concern, then please reach out to one of the center directors or another trusted departmental member who can assist.

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.
